# python_sample_code

Providing some sample code that is publicly available. Because most of my repositories are private (not on GitHub).

The document is redacted, which means a lot has been removed.

**Things not included** (mainly because I would have to redact tons of code specifically made, therefore making them useless).
- documentation pertaining to data
- scripts used for analysis (ps1 and sh)
- TensorFlow implementation in conjunction
- Papers pertaining to the research
- robust images of anomaly classifications
- utility functions (i.e. preprocessing functions)
- Other custom machine learning models for high-dimensional and large time-series data
- Diagrams for commands, memory management, diagram process
